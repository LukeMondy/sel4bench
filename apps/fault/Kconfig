    # the fault benchmark triggers an undefined instruction, which does not work on
    # armv6 as undefined instruction is leveraged to read the cycle count efficiently
    # when benchmarking seL4. This only occurs when CONFIG_DANGEROUS_CODE_INJECTION
    # is enabled, however this option is enabled by sel4bench in order to read the cycle
    # counter.
